        <h1>Appearance</h1>
        <div class="line"> </div>
        <p> Yamaguchi is a young-looking boy with an average build. He has dark grayish-green hair with a flyaway piece of hair sticking up at the top. Back in middle school, he was teased for his freckles and overall scrawniness. He seems to have grown into it now and isn't bothered about it as much.

            After joining the Karasuno volleyball team during games, Yamaguchi wears Karasuno's black, orange, and white uniform with the number 12 on the back. He also wears knee pads and white volleyball shoes with black accents.

            Outside of matches and practice, Yamaguchi wears a black gakuran, the Karasuno uniform.</p>

        <h1> Personality</h1>
       <p> Yamaguchi is a pretty shy person who relies on others. Though he is generally a nice person, he tends to snicker along or join in with Tsukishima whenever he's mocking others, especially Kageyama and Hinata. This also proves that he is a loyal friend who cares a lot for his friends, constantly shouting encouragements from the sidelines and defending Tsukishima.

        When he was young he was bullied for his freckles/acne which led to him being extremely insecure. He constantly doubts his abilities and finds it hard to concentrate with a large crowd. He is also easily nervous, as he always seem to jump whenever the referee blows the whistle for his serve.

        He is hardworking, as shown when he sought for extra training on his own and how he continued practicing outside of the team, after seeing how weak he was compared to his other teammates.

           After a fatal loss in the match against Aoba Johsai High, he gained a lot of confidence thanks to his teammates and Makoto Shimada, who has helped him practice the jump float serve. During the summer training camp, he even stood up against Kei Tsukishima, resulting in him being surprised at Yamaguchi's actions and even calling him "cool" for the first time. Tsukishima started working harder, and their relationship returned to normal after that event.</p>

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <div class="line"> </div>
        <p> Back in elementary school, Yamaguchi was teased for his freckles and overall scrawniness. Once Tsukishima saved him from some boys who bullied him by calling them pathetic. Despite thinking that he was included among the ones Tsukishima insulted, Yamaguchi still grew attached to him and looked up to him, he set his goal to become "as cool as him". He is later revealed to want to join a sports club but decided against soccer and basketball because the other players were 'big and scary' and volleyball seemed a safer choice. </p>
